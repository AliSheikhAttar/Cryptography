# Linear cryptanalysis attack on SNOW 2.0
- implement in C++
- output the biases
- calculate the linear approximation of the SNOW 2.0 substitution box (S-box).
- This means the program will take 32-bit masks as input and output the probability of equality (bias). 

- Refer to page 91 of the book by Stevenson (relevant content will, God willing, be taught next week).

- The program display the execution time to record the achievement.

- precomputed table is not used.

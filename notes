kinds of attacks : key recoverey, distinguishing
key recovery : relationship between inputs
distinguishing : relationship between output keys
differential attack problem : states are dependant to each other because of calculation in the fsm so pilling up lema cant be used

concentrate on last bit of output inn boolean function: 100 more clocked -> more randomness
